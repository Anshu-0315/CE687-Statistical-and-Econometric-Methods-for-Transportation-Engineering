## Pedestrian Volume Modelling
## Overview
- Developed pedestrian exposure models using traffic, demographic, and built-environment data with linear and log-linear regression.
- Conducted statistical analyses (t-tests, correlations, confidence intervals) to compare district-wise pedestrian volumes and identify key predictors.
- Engineered features such as population, households, employment, and roadway design to enhance model accuracy.
- Evaluated model performance with RÂ², AIC/BIC, RMSE, and recommended refined log-linear models for better predictive accuracy.
