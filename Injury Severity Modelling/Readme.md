## Injury Severity Modelling
## Overview
- Developed ordered response models (Ordered Logit and Probit) in R to analyze injury severity outcomes of motorcycle crashes using Michigan crash dataset.
- Engineered explanatory variables (speed limit, crash time, urban/rural, pedestrian involvement, parked vehicle, lighting condition, road surface, collision type).
- Conducted model performance evaluation using Log-Likelihood, AIC, BIC, and McFadden’s Pseudo-R², demonstrating improved fit after introducing additional predictors.
- Interpreted statistical significance and practical implications of crash factors (e.g., poor lighting and head-on collisions increase severity), providing data-driven insights for road safety interventions.
